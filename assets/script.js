She pulls me through the door and throws her arms around me even though my clothes are
soaking wet and my hair drips onto her cheeks.
“You found it!” Her accent is impossibly complex, just as I remember it.
She lets go to look me over as I glance around the room, a narrow restaurant with a
single row of booths against the wall. Other than candles on tables the room is lit
only by one big window next to the door, where rain crackles steadily and evening
twilight flows down it like pale blue dye. The back booth is occupied by three men with
ruddy faces, taunting each other and cackling as they toss back shots of a clear alcohol
that smells like gasoline.

Shui Yang swings the door shut, the vast city rush outside falls to a hush, though the
door doesn’t quite close all the way, allowing a cool breeze to seep in. She sits down
across from me, folds her hands on the table and frowns. She’s so similar in every way
to how she was ten years ago when she was an exchange student living in my house, catlike
in features and demeanor, almost well dressed and groomed but always giving the impression
that she just got out of bed.
“I should give you the bad news first,” she sighs, “I’m moving away.”
“Goddamn it,” I reply before I can catch myself, “I mean... why?”
“This city...” she pauses, smiling now in that thoughtful way she’s always had, “it can
make some people insane.”
“Did that happen to you?”
“Perhaps,” now I can’t tell if she’s smiling or frowning, “but it’s not my own sanity
that worries me.” She still has that cryptic way of speaking, of turning everything into
puzzles.
“So where will you go?”
“I have a job lined up in Nan Jing. Still a big city, but not like this.”
“Is it far? Can I visit you there?”
“Not far,” she smiles again, “and of course you can.”
An old man shuffles over to our table to clunk down a bowl of peanuts, two pairs of
chopsticks, and two beers. Shui Yang asks him for something, he smiles toothlessly and
shuffles away.
“So you will be staying with your friend Robby?” she turns to me again, “so nice you
have another friend on this side of the world, otherwise I would feel really bad about
leaving.”
“It is lucky,” I agree, “although I haven’t seen him for almost as long as I hadn’t seen
you.”
“Is he still... you know...”
“Sick?” I finish for her, “No I don’t think so.” More likely it’s me who’s sick now.
“Can I give you something? I mean... can I have you keep something for me?”
“Um, sure.”
She hands me a black cardboard box, like a shoebox but longer, the lid held closed with
silver-grey duct tape.
“What is it?” It’s somewhat heavier than I expected.
“Kind of hard to explain, but don’t worry I’ll pick it up next time I come to the city.
How is your family?” She changes the subject so casually that I actually can’t tell if the
box contains a personal secret or something so irrelevant that it doesn’t even merit the
question. Either way I decide to not ask again, and I put the box down next to me on the booth.
I fill her in on the family matters back home, she nods along with wide eyes and those cute
little musical notes I remember so well, “Mmm... oo-ooh... a-hmm... oo!”
The men in back pound their table, candlelight flickering on their flushed faces as they laugh
so hard they choke and cough, and then the waiter brings them another bottle of baijiu and they
pour another round.

“So were you pulled away from home, or pushed away?” she asks next.
Rain tap-dances on the window behind my head, the men shoot back another shot, and I try to
retrace the thread of events that led me here. Most recently the frustration of living with my
parents as they negotiate a divorce, and before that there was the money I borrowed from them for
illegitimate reasons, and before that the shameful return to Minnesota after my life blew up in
Colorado, and before that the car crash, and before that losing the only job I ever actually
enjoyed, and before that being dumped by my girlfriend unexpectedly, and before that...
“Pushed,” I gasp at last, though pushed by exactly what or whom I couldn’t say.
She smirks, “You had to think about it though.”
“Well... there are lots of reasons. I had to think through the different levels.”
“I’m not sure why,” she flings half a peanut into her mouth with her chopsticks, “but that made
me think of an art exhibit I saw at M50. It’s like an elevator that takes you up a building where
each floor is a different theme, and each one relates to the symbolic meaning of the level it’s on.
So the third floor has the theme of regeneration, the fourth floor has the theme of death, the
eighth floor has the theme of fortune, and the ninth—“
She’s cut off by the toothless waiter returning with several plates of food, amazing things I’ve
never seen before, mysterious and alluring aromas of oil, herbs, and Eastern spices.
“Anyway, you should go see it. I think you would really like M50.”
We eat and drink and catch up some more, while the men in back howl red-faced, jeering and cheering.
My belly fills and makes me feel warm, overcoming the chill from my wet clothes, though when we get
up to leave I don’t quite feel ready to go back outside.
                
It’s still raining, but not nearly so hard as when I walked in, indigo clouds sinking to the ground,
shrouding the night in mist. Humming streetlamps line the road with a rosy glow, and above that
yellow windows blink open and closed along the shadowy stone walls of old lanehouses.
Next to Shui Yang under her umbrella, so well put together in raincoat and scarf, I try to cover her
oblong shoebox with my already damp shirt, shivering like the weird foreign creature I am. Soon a
lazy pink taxi drips down the street, and Shui Yang insists that I take it. She hugs me goodbye and
then gives the driver instructions while I climb in.
“Welcome to China,” she smiles, closing the door.
The taxi rolls on down the street, gathering speed as we splash through dazzling thoroughfares in a
giant, sleepless city. Lights and colors flow together all wet around me, along with the growl of an
old engine, the hush of wind at the windows, an alien language on the radio.`

let longQuote2 = `The Shelter

The rain has stopped and the clouds, black as coal-fired smoke, begin to break apart and blow away as I cross the bridge
over the train yard. Water has filled in the spaces between the tracks, making the Earth a broken mirror reflecting a
broken sky. The sun bursts out of a crag in the clouds, red in the face, furious, falling toward the jagged horizon.
Strange energy to bring to an interview, strange part of town anyway, and the deserted shopping mall I find is stranger
still. But on the fourth floor in a back hallway I find the learning center, perfectly pleasant with the green
color-scheme and animal cartoons in the window. I dressed well, too well apparently, because the young woman who
interviews me says I look too ‘cool’ to teach children, though I think she means ‘cold’.
I have trouble cranking up a positive attitude, despite the sheer luck of landing this interview. It was only random
chance that a friend of a friend of Robby’s—or wait, it’s Robin now—knew about the open position, and that I happened to
hear about it. But apparently I play the part convincingly enough because she not only offers to let me start teaching
right away, but to also apply for my work visa and sign me on to a salaried contract. She gives me the documents to
bring home and read over, and sends me out the door with an outpouring of encouragement.
As I cross the bridge over the train yard in the other direction and see that fuming mad sun caught in a chink in the
skyline I start to ruminate on the risk of submitting documents to the government while Haxa’s agency is under
investigation. I should ask someone with more legal knowledge than myself before turning in the application, but for now
I choose to celebrate—clearly I’m getting better at this kind of thing.
With the success of the interview, and after all the stress and confusion of the previous couple of weeks, I feel in the
mood to party, to cut loose, get wild, and at least pretend to be carefree. I take out Haxa’s big red square of a phone
to call Robin and tell him to pick up booze, but then I remember that he doesn’t have a phone at the moment—for a reason
so strange that I keep forgetting it actually happened.
I think back on it as I board the subway, the way Robby came home one day with his hair cut short except for the bangs
and his beard shaved off. “Call me Robin from now on,” he said just before taking out his phone and hurling it against
the wall, and then stomping on it where it fell. “I need to be sure that part of my ego is dead,” he said, picking up
the mangled device and tossing it in the trash.
Since then he’s been looking and acting much like the teenager I knew ten years ago, repeatedly playing music and movies
that were central to our identities in those years, even re-reading the same Stephen King book series we’d obsessed over
back then, as well as reminiscing endlessly about the people we used to know, the things we used to do, the places we
went and the times we had, both good and bad. He does not seem unhappy, if a little bit mad, and when I did finally ask
him just what exactly was going on his explanation was at least logical, more or less.
“I have to start over,” he said, “I don’t like the person I became, so I have to go back to where things first went
wrong, before the bridge incident.”

I stop at the store for beer on the way home, but when I get there find that I need not have done so, for Robin has
filled the fridge not only with beer but also soju, sake, and baijiu. Furthermore he’s dug out a bottle of Adderall that
Andrea left behind, and is currently grinding it down and snorting it up through a 100 RMB note rolled into a
straw—Mao’s fat face wrapped around the little pink tube.
“I know the perfect place for us to go tonight,” he insists as he pours me a shot of soju and hands me the straw.
“And where’s that?” I ask, snorting up a line.
“You’re going to love it,” he replies mischievously, “you’ll see.”
“Can I ask you,” I change the subject, “what your coworkers said about your new look?”
“No one said anything,” he seems irritated by the question, although he’s so wound up from the drugs it’s hard to tell,
“except that one you like, Anna.”
“What did she say?”
“That my energy is unbalanced or something like that. Too much yin, not enough yang... or maybe it’s the other way
around. Either way, she says the ratios are off; hot and cold, light and dark, fast and slow, old and new.”
“Too much past and not enough future?”
“Or too much booze and not enough speed! Come on dude, snort that, shoot this, and let’s get fucking gone!

In World War Two it was a bomb shelter for Shanghai’s political elite, a metal slab door covered in graffiti on the side
of the road with no sign, just the deep dmm-dmm drumming underfoot. Violet light lulls us in through the door and down
the stairs and even deeper down a rough rock tunnel where the drumming grows louder DMM-DMM darting lasers lighting the
fog at the end of the tunnel. The underground chamber opens onto a dancefloor with a low ceiling and everything painted
black. The DJ in the corner spinning on an antique analog system, all retro-patched and pirate-wired, old-school punk
rock overlaid with ‘80s club pop, overlaid with jungle, dub, and two-step chopped and screwed all the way up or down,
fine-grain future powder up the nose makes everything faster. The Power! From midnight through the witching hour, ‘til
dawn it’s rocking all night long. In the Shelter, helter-skelter, foot-stomping, gone.
Past the DJ and the bar another tunnel leads even deeper, through tiled archways into an arcade lined with black leather
couches where the real rockers get bombed. Robin and I retreat there when the music gets so fast that we have to slow
our hearts down, our conversation sped up and wild, sincere but sincerely misguided.
“I think I really think, I see the way you’re looking at me but I really think she might be a demon or something—“
“A demon?! A supernatural force of evil—”
“I mean she’s clearly not quite human it’s just a question of whether it’s something more or something less—“
“Dude you’re blowing up this huge deal out of what she did to you and making it worse—“
“She’s like dark matter like made out of non-matter and we can only see her because it’s where other matter isn’t!”
“She’s just crazy man and you gotta forget about it if you ever want to get past it—“
“But I can’t because it feels like she took something from me like something important—“
“Yeah she took your phone—“
“Yeah well that too but I mean something deep like from deep inside—“
“Dude I’m serious you seriously need to chill—“
“Do you smell that?” A friendly plume of marijuana smoke has drifted into our booth from an adjacent one where two
people are passing a joint. “I want to hit that.”
“Let’s go for it.”
We stand up and approach the other booth. At the same time those two people stand up to leave, all of us stopping face
to face, recognizing each other with a sort of pop like a bursting bubble. One of them is Graham McKenzie, Robin’s boss
who threw the jungle party, standing a head above all of us in a gleaming white three-piece suit topped off with a pink
bowtie. The other is Anna, the elusive poet with the steamy voice, the lion in deer’s clothing who danced to silence on
the balcony. Here and now she’s wearing a simple shift dress that somehow clings to her figure, hot colors with black
stripes, one red feather of hair that swings past her eyes, past the glint in her playful squint, past the curl of her
grinning lips.
“Robin!” she cries with heart-warming enthusiasm. “How’s your night going?”
“It’s the best night I’ve ever had in my whole life!” he replies so fast that the words crash into each other, but the
tense expression on his face belies what he said.
“You’re Dylan, right?” Graham says to me, after a concerned look at Robin. “I think you came to one of my parties.”
“Yes, and you came to the Spoken Word club!” Anna says, beaming at me now, “Your poem was so interesting… very strange…
almost nice.”
We follow them out of the arcade and back to the black dance floor. I talk at Anna in a constant stream, my voice
growing hoarse from shouting over the constant DMM-DMM drumming. I ask her all kinds of questions, about writing poetry,
about music, about her life, but I can hardly wait for the answers, can’t stop myself from gushing over her with my own
thoughts and feelings.
“I love to write more than anything,” she tells me, “Except for painting.”
“I love to write too!” I cry, “But I don’t have time! And I’d rather play music anyway, I like music more than poetry.”
“But poetry is just a simple form of music,” her eyes bright despite the surrounding darkness, smiling wide, her voice
weightless on the air as she is on her feet, dancing like a pretty pink butterfly like the one tattooed on her breast.
By this time the dancefloor has filled in to a wet, hot mass where we’ve lost both Graham and Robin, so we decide to
leave. Back out of the rocky tunnel and up the stairs, out to a quiet sleepy street as the sky is just beginning to get
light. Anna approaches a taxi that is waiting at the curb and opens the door, then turns to me and asks if I’m coming
with her. Trying not to sound too eager I reply that yes I am.

I notice a copy of Island lying on her bedside table.
“So you have to read this too?” I ask her as I unbutton my shirt. “Robby tells me it’s good.”
“I don’t have to read it,” she replies as she throws a pink shawl over the lamp to make the room all rosy, “I like to.
It’s interesting, actually enlightening.” And then she teases me with a look and a pose that makes everything outside
the room irrelevant, the vast sleepless city around us no more than a brilliant backdrop on our stage. Hot magic, her
fragrance; it reminds me of the ma spice, the lip-tingling seedpod so unique to the Far East that there isn’t even an
English word for it.
Though we barely know each other it feels as though we’ve been together many times before, in past lives perhaps, and
this only the latest incarnation of our timeless attraction. I feel the pull of the stars, feel the turning of a cosmic
wheel.
“Dylan,” she whispers, her face close to mine, “can I ask you how you got this scar?” She traces the jagged X on my
chest with the tender tips of her fingers. I look into those clear eyes in her flushed face and I know that right now I
can’t tell her the truth, but one day I hope to.
“I wanted to drive my car at full speed, just to see if I could handle it.”
“But you couldn’t handle it?”
“I’m alive, aren’t I?”
She hums with laughter, “I’m glad you are.”`

On the floor my phone trembled, filling with demands from the institute. I’d been urging them for weeks to send
me more students, but in this moment of exhaustion I deeply regretted it. I already had a substantial class load,
smeared across a twelve hour schedule, and much of the time in between was spent racing across central Santiago,
in and out of the stifling, sweat-damp subway, on and off of outdated buses that heaved side to side in traffic
and bled diesel smoke straight into the coach, often having to run for blocks to be on time for class, often
being a few minutes late anyway.
Most days I ended with red eyes, brown dust stuck to my cheeks, and my clothes all greasy on the inside from the
near-constant perspiration. I was barely maintaining equilibrium, but I needed money; needed it in a general way,
but more specifically to get out of this goddamn rat trap of an apartment, this tiny square studio on the ground
floor of a hideous brown cube right on the curb of a major road.
The air in here was so stale I could taste it, but I couldn’t open the windows because then the exhaust from the
thoroughfare outside poured in, and the noise was unbearable anyway. I was no stranger to gutter-level living—had
suffered with rats, horny alley cats, giant cockroaches, and fleas in Shanghai, where I’d first hardened into the
wannabe gonzo journalist I was now—but this particular apartment was pushing me to new limits. The kitchen was
inside of a closet, with jerry-rigged gas lines connecting the stove and water heater; the asbestos ceiling slowed
my phone signal, and there was no other form of internet connection; the TV was a tiny old tube-screen, and received
only seven channels, all of which were godawful boring and in Spanish of course, of which I could understand only
bits and pieces.
This meant I had no entertainment or distractions besides a couple of old books, and was forced to consider each
night the grim record of my teenage years that I had brought along as a reference for my protest culture research:
an abysmally bleak collection of journal entries, which included descriptions of protests I’d participated in.
When I couldn’t stand the stupid public TV channels anymore, all I could do was stare at that Doom Journal, daring
myself—but always failing—to read it.
That infernal thing often weighed heavy on me in the morning, with my brain inflamed from the previous night’s
libations, and the day’s work still looming ahead. I was in such a mood this morning as I faced the faceless
administrator’s pressing messages: two new students, slated to start today, should I choose to accept them. I did
so mindlessly, thinking only of my bank account, and then suppressed a shiver of rage. I would have no time to drink
coffee now, nor even take a shit, I had to leave right now—it was for days like this I kept my briefcase loaded with
tobacco and a liquor flask.

My first new student called me into his office at 9:00 on the dot. On the 50th floor of the Titanium building, his
office was glossy, minimalist, immaculately clean, with an incredible view of the towering, snow-peaked Cordilleras,
where the morning sun painted a sumptuous pink and yellow tableau, colors that dripped onto the glittering windows
of the city far, far below.
The man himself was polite, but he cast an imposing presence. He was probably in his early fifties, a bit taller than
average and exceptionally muscular, shaved of head, his khaki pants and light blue shirt totally crisp and wrinkle
free. But what unnerved me about him were his intense yellow eyes, unwavering, unblinking, humorless stones in his
head, exacting and sober and serious.
“My last teacher was good at running out the clock,” he fired at me, laser focused, “so I had to run him out of here.”
He was extremely direct and totally uninterested in small talk, truly unlike any Chilean I’d met before, a veritable
anomaly I didn’t feel prepared to handle at this early hour. His English was already advanced, to the point where I
wasn’t quite sure how I would help him improve. But he seemed to be pleased with how I carried out our first class.
He gave me an excessively firm handshake on my way out the door, saying he looked forward to our next meeting.
I was relieved to discover that my other new client was much easier to work with, a guy exactly my own age, who had a
number of similar interests and tastes as myself, and who even looked a bit like me, just with somewhat darker skin
and no ponytail. He had a similar background too, of apparently upper-middle-class upbringing and a liberal arts
education. Yet our paths of adulthood could hardly have been more different.
He lived on a predictable schedule, day to day and week to week, and with incremental changes year after year, almost
a decade on end of linear progress in the jobs, projects, and pastimes he had chosen long ago. He was working his way
up the corporate ladder, he played in an amateur soccer league, he was engaged and planning for a family.
It was a startling reflection on my own life. I hadn’t followed any semblance of a consistent plan, hadn’t even known
how to make one. I’d studied journalism and then what? Fucked off to Shanghai to sorta kinda teach English but mostly
just burn through family money, get chewed up and spit back out in Minneapolis where I rolled around like a lopsided
tricycle, rusting from ruminating in my own regrets, restless but felt so helpless, directionless, without a mission
or a cause ‘til I picked up blank notebook and penned the long-gnawing thoughts in my head, started the snowball
rolling and followed where it led, chasing the rebound all the way down to the south of South America, landing in the
same situation that started it all in the first place, and now reflecting on it in a random office with a living
mirror who proved my life made no sense...
“Is that correct, Dylan?” Mario was asking me, a hint of concern in his voice. He was looking at me sideways, and I
felt like the room was twisting. 
“Que? I mean, what?” I was painfully thirsty, hands felt shaky.
“I share a condom with my fathers.”
“Uhhm… Wait, I’m sorry, what are we talking about?”
“I live with my fathers in a condom.”
“Ah-ha,” I felt relieved, “you share a condo with your parents.”
“No,” he looked confused, “condor it’s a bird.”
“You share a bird with your parents?”
“Que? I mean, what?”
The class continued in this confusing manner for a while, until with a wave of relief my workday finally ended. I
decided to walk home, to quickly soak in a pint of beer and unwind some of my high-tuned nerves. But when I tried to
cross Plaza De Dignidad I saw, surrounding the statue of Baquedano on his horse, a cluster of black-clad anarchists,
waving red flags and chanting, circling, beating bucket drums in a rifle-march rhythm, hurling flaming trash bags at the
oncoming battalion—for hurtling towards them came a convoy of armored trucks spewing thick grey mace clouds, and ranks
of riot cops marching out from the side streets, swinging clubs and launching tear gas cannisters from hand-cannons, a
deafening BANG-ANG-ang with each one as they echoed off the surrounding buildings.
“NO PAZ,” the rebels cried, “SIN JUSTICIA!” 
The police pulled back to form a line, and then launched so much mace at the black-rag swarm that it hid them in a grey
cloud, though their drums still rang out clear. Then from out of the haze, cannisters came sailing back, smoke tails
arcing towards the armored cops, who broke their ranks and charged into the breach. But they swung and grasped at naught
but air, for as the grey cloud blew out of the Plaza I saw the anarchists had scattered, leaving nothing but smoldering
trash fires.
There was some meat for my story, now I just needed a place to write it down.

let longQuote4 = `	The following two days we spent either in bed, in the kitchen, or on the balcony smoking cigarettes and listening
to the sounds of battle in the distance, as well as the low rumblings of massive military convoys, which the president had finally
called in to take hold of the situation.
That in itself—the deploying of military forces to control the population—was an incredibly precarious political move, however necessary
it may have been from an economic perspective. The dark reflection in Camila’s eyes, and in Rodrigo’s, and even in the news anchors’ as
they relayed the message to us, was enough to infer that a significant cultural line had been crossed.
It was the first time since the end of the dictatorship thirty years before, they explained, that the military had been activated against
Chilean civilians. The immediate result was that looting came almost to a stop, but the protest crowd in Plaza De Dignidad grew
dramatically day by day, peaceful while the sun was up, but devolving into riots each night.
Due to strict curfews, as well as business owners choosing not to unlock their doors in any case, the surrounding city seemed deserted,
save for the sporadic clashing of the army and the cops against guerrilla activists and mercenary looters.

Camila finally went home on Monday afternoon, though even then it was complicated to do so. Most businesses remained shut, hardly any
public transportation was running, even hailing a private ride took almost an hour, rather than the usual few minutes.
I kissed her goodbye at the front gate of the building. I was surprised that even after being locked in with her the whole weekend, I
didn’t want her to leave. But she needed to see her parents of course, what with the national crisis and all.

The week that followed was slow and tense. All my classes canceled, nothing open and nowhere to go besides the supermarket, and that
place surrounded by guards as if it were some strategic fort. I relished the time to write, at first. But the events of the weekend
didn’t feel like the end of the story at all, it felt more like a beginning, and everything I’d tried to cover so far had only been a
prologue. Events were headed somewhere even more fascinating, more historically significant, and it felt like jumping the gun to start
writing about it now.
So I sat at my desk and drank my stash dry, watching smoggy sunsets with an endless soundtrack of cacerolazos clinking spoons on metal
pots echoing all over the city, and the growling of military trucks prowling the empty avenues.
By Friday, a week after things had begun, the riots and looting were much sparser, the military backed off a bit, and the city opened
up just a little. One might have expected that the major demonstrations were over. Peaceful rallies had continued every day in Plaza De
Dignidad, but the citywide lockdown had contained the most chaotic elements and brought them down to a simmer.

At this point I wasn’t particularly concerned about any outright violence breaking out—there didn’t seem to be murderous intent on any
side, this wasn’t a war—and now I was itching to get out and observe some of the action, maybe even participate a little. So it felt
fortuitous when Camila called me that afternoon, and asked if I wanted to join her for that day’s march on Plaza De Dignidad, which was
expected to be huge. She asked me to meet her at a friend of her brother’s apartment, a building directly at the foot of Santa Lucia
(the sacred hill in the center of the city topped with the ruins of several civilizations).
On the way there I saw the streets hectic with movement, protesters streaming towards Plaza De Dignidad, while businesses scrambled to
close up, intersections almost gridlocked by excited pedestrians. I rang the doorbell of a battered antique mansion, at what I assumed
to be the right entrance, an iron gate set in a graffiti-covered red stone façade. Camila sprang out from the shadows of the stairwell
with a bright smile and let me in.
Upstairs in the apartment—in a high-ceilinged sitting room with peeling walls and cracked wooden rafters—she introduced me to some
friends of her brother. Jorge, the owner of the apartment was a broad-bodied and jovial looking guy, who greeted me with a comment I
didn’t understand, “va a estar la caga por la chucha weon conchatumadre,” but which got a good laugh out of the others.
There was Diego, a studious looking guy in a black turtleneck, with turtle-shell glasses and a goatee, and then there was Benedicto,
who lived here with Jorge, the artist who painted with needle and thread on fabric canvasses, whose studio—through the French doors at
the back of the sitting room—looked like a typhoon had hit a tailor shop.
“Did you bring a limon?” Jorge asked me with a grin.
“No, shit was I supposed to?”
“For the tear gas,” Diego added, “so you can breathe.”
“Oh right,” it seemed obvious to me now, recalling that it had been only a couple of months ago Camila had saved me with that very
thing.
“No worry, I have for you,” Jorge assured me, and went off to retrieve one from another room in back.
“Are you ready?” Camila nudged me, smiling excitedly, raising her eyebrows. “Going to be a huge! Un manifestacion por la historia!”
We all said cheers and drank a couple of beers together, me following the Chileno as best I could. And then, on a cue that went over
my head, they all stood up and tied bandannas around their necks, and together we hurried down the spiral stairs and out the door.

Hidden oasis,
Where Isis awaits,
Purring, pearlescent,
The Sphinx awakes.

Ivy-curled colonnades unfold,
A bird-headed golden god enthroned.
A river of wine flows forth from her tomb,
From the doorway to heaven,
From her open womb.

Selah

Blinding patterned silence in a great white web,
The open mind is petrified by an infantile regression.
A voice like death fills in the chest, eyes open wide.
The self dissolves, unraveling perception,
As one life to the next we fall.
As the brain to the mind,
And the body to the soul,
The lock is large
But the key is small.

So trip unto writ,
As writ to a trip.
The penny dropped
And fell to bits.

At some point near the beginning of 2021, I needed something to listen to while walking to the grocery store,
and having had my fill of music at that moment (a pretty unusual feeling for me) I decided to try listening to
a podcast, and just through random choice tried out Hardcore History with Dan Carlin.

If you are already familiar with Dan Carlin you probably don’t need to hear me explain it, but as someone new to
his podcast I was totally blown away. He talks about ancient history in a way that makes it relatable, visceral,
and—unlike so many other historians—human. With Hardcore History, you don’t just get an explanation of events,
you get an experiential dive into the time period.

I’ve always been enamored with ancient history, but usually find historical non-fiction writing and documentaries
so dry and lifeless that it kind of kills the magic of learning about the subject. With Dan Carlin, not only does
the history come alive, but it somehow feels even more magical and fascinating than it did before—he has a way of
making the mystery ever deeper, even as he uncovers it.

And so over the last year I spent many many hours listening to those very very old true stories, rather than reading
modern fiction as I typically do.

One of the refrains that Dan Carlin repeats in many of his episodes is that ‘history has ruined fiction’ for him.
The first time I heard him say that I thought, that’s silly, it would never happen to me. I love history, but not as
much as I love novels. But then after several months of listening to pretty much nothing else, I started to wonder if
maybe he was right, and that nothing fictional can even compare to real history.

It might sound strange at first, what with the majority of historical non-fiction being portrayed dull as a rusty spoon,
but when you start to fathom the lives that some of these remarkable people led—real lives that we can verify with relative
certainty—it’s kind of astounding we have any need for fiction at all.

I used to think that right now we live in a time of extreme experience, where we modern humans get to feel, see, and hear things
that our ancestors couldn’t even dream of. In some ways that’s true, but in many ways the reality is the opposite. The extremes of
experience that ancient people went through would be utterly mind-shattering for most modern people today, experiences that we can’t
begin to comprehend from our modern vantage point.

What was it like to encounter a hitherto unknown ethno-cultural group of people, when they show up at the edge of your town with
thousands of fearsome, alien-looking warriors, and now you have to pick up a sharp hunk of metal and try to stab them all to death
while they try to do the same to you, all face-to-face and flesh-to-flesh, or else you and everyone you know will probably be dead by
the end of the day?

That’s the kind of shit that happened hundreds and thousands of times to our own ancestors, happened to many of them multiple times,
and certain extraordinary individuals experienced situations like that dozens of times over; quite a few of them even seemed to enjoy it,
according to ancient accounts.

But instead of learning about those real incredible people and real incredible moments, here we are reading fabricated pulp about
horny teenage robots or something. What’s the deal with that?

…

But I don’t really feel that way. Regardless of how fascinating real history may be, I can’t even imagine giving up all the great fictional
stories I’ve read, watched, or listened to in my life. I couldn’t even consider sacrificing all the inspiration and meaning and empowerment
I’ve gleaned from them.

There are truly unbelievable stories in the past, more incredible than any fiction, and yet I still feel that fiction serves a separate,
yet equally essential, purpose. Because no matter how incredible a true story may be, we cannot experience it as an audience without making
fundamental assumptions—about the states of mind of the people involved, their subconscious motivations, the deep nature of their relationships,
the actual sensory input they experienced, where they put their attention and focus—that automatically fictionalize the account.
In order for us as the audience to in any way ‘experience’ the story, it must have some semblance of narrative, and if there is any sense of
narrative at all, the story has moved beyond pure historical fact and towards fiction.

Which leads to the next source of value in fiction: the meaning. While I don’t think all stories should have a clear ‘message’ to them, I think
any good narrative will at least ask some questions around an existential theme or philosophy. Here again, if we do this to a historical account
we are automatically making assumptions and applying a perspective, and probably cherry picking events that fit the intended narrative.
While I think some amount of theme and philosophical narrative can reasonably be applied to historical accounts with them still qualifying as
non-fiction, it does create a major limitation to the narrative if you want to remain factually accurate. This is a limitation that fiction does
not have, which sets it free to explore so many possibilities within the human spirit that non-fiction, by its own virtues, cannot.

Finally, there is style. Once again, exceptionally well-written non-fiction may be able to pull off a certain amount of style without undermining
its integrity, but once again it will be severely limited in this regard. Every stylistic choice by an author necessitates a perspective and
underlying assumptions, and therefore can only go so far before it betrays its factuality.

A fictional manuscript, on the other hand, can take its style to the furthest extremes, and not only will this not compromise the story, it will
often enhance it.

To illustrate, I’m going to cross-reference the non-fiction book Empire Of The Summer Moon, which explores the culture and geopolitics of the
Comanche empire, with the fictional Blood Meridian, which (in some chapters) describes a bloody conflict between the Apache nation and a mercenary
militia.

(I certainly don’t mean to suggest that Comanches and Apaches were the same ethno-cultural group or that we can treat them as interchangeable,
but for the sake of this comparison I believe that they are similar enough; S.C. Gwynne, the author of Empire Of The Summer Moon actually quotes
Cormac McCarthy at the beginning of the book, and it’s clear his non-fiction investigation of the Comanches was partly inspired by McCarthy’s
writing about the Apaches… further evidence to support my thesis here about the different but equally important functions of fiction and non-fiction).

Empire Of The Summer Moon: “For now, Mackenzie was the instrument of retribution. He had been dispatched to kill Comanches in their Great Plains
fastness because, six years after the end of the Civil War, the western frontier was an open and bleeding wound, a smoking ruin littered with corpses
and charred chimneys, a place where anarchy and torture killings had replaced the rule of law, where Indians and especially Comanches raided at will.
Victorious in war, unchallenged by foreign foes in North America for the first time in its history, the Union now found itself unable to deal with the
handful of remaining Indian tribes that had not been destroyed, assimilated, or forced to retreat meekly onto reservations where they quickly learned
the meaning of abject subjugation and starvation. The hostiles were all residents of the Great Plains; all were mounted, well armed, and driven now by
a mixture of vengeance and political desperation. They were Comanches, Kiowas, Arapahoes, Cheyennes, and Western Sioux. For Mackenzie on the southern
plains, Comanches were the obvious target: No tribe in the history of the Spanish, French, Mexican, Texan, and American occupations of this land had
ever caused so much havoc and death. None was even a close second.”

Blood Meridian: “A legion of horribles, hundreds in number, half naked or clad in costumes attic or biblical or wardrobed out of a fevered dream with
the skins of animals and silk finery and pieces of uniform still tracked with the blood of prior owners, coats of slain dragoons, frogged and braided
cavalry jackets, one in a stovepipe hat and one with an umbrella and one in white stockings and a bloodstained wedding veil and some in headgear of crane
feathers or rawhide helmets that bore the horns of bull or buffalo and one in a pigeon-tailed coat worn backwards and otherwise naked and one in the armor
of a spanish conquistador, the breastplate and pauldrons deeply dented with old blows of mace or saber done in another country by men whose very bones were
dust and many with their braids spliced up with the hair of other beasts until they trailed upon the ground and their horses’ ears and tails worked with
bits of brightly colored cloth and one whose horse’s whole head was painted crimson red and all the horsemen’s faces gaudy and grotesque with daubings like
a company of mounted clowns, death hilarious, all howling in a barbarous tongue and riding down upon them like a horde from a hell more horrible yet than
the brimstone land of Christian reckoning, screeching and yammering and clothed in smoke like those vaporous beings in regions beyond right knowing where
the eye wanders and the lip jerks and drools.”

You will notice that, despite being exceptionally descriptive and stylized for its genre, Empire gives us more of a bird’s-eye view, a generalized and
somewhat detached explanation of something happening elsewhere to other people. Meridian on the other hand, puts us directly in the experience, as if we
are there in the protagonist’s shoes, feeling what he’s feeling. Both fascinating, both highly engaging, with similar yet different intentions and similar
yet different effects on the reader.

So… all this is just a long-winded way of saying that, while real history is head-bustingly unbelievable and is utterly invaluable for so many reasons, that
does not mean that fiction is not also very valuable for its own reasons. Fiction serves a similar but essentially different purpose.
And the great thing is that there is plenty of room for both. There is no reason one cannot consume equal parts history and fantasy, and I believe anyone
who does so will see how the differences between the two are part of the reason each is so valuable.
